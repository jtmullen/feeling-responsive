We are pleased to announce that Revision A of the FSGP 2023 Regulations and the ASC 2024 Regulations have now been published to our website. The most significant change here is allowing 3 wheeled vehicles again in the Single Occupant Vehicle (SOV) class in alignment with the World Solar Challenge. A summary of significant changes from the ASC 2022 regulations can be found in the Revision Table Appendix of the Regulation documents. Another important note is that starting with this release, new regulation sets will now be introduced for FSGP track events with the hopes that by the time ASC happens, solar cars will have already competed in an FSGP track race such that teams have experience with their vehicle and time to implement improvements before competing in the cross-country American Solar Challenge.
