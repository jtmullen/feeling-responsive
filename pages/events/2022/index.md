 Collegiate solar car teams will have the opportunity to compete in both the Formula Sun Grand Prix (FSGP) track event and the American Solar Challenge (ASC) road event. Scrutineering and FSGP will be held at Heartland Motorsports Park in Topeka, KS. In partnership with the National Park Service, ASC will start in Independence, MO and follow the Oregon Trail westward, ending in Twin Falls, ID. Detailed planning is currently underway for these events.
 
 Entries may compete with either Single-Occupant Vehicles (SOV) the Multi-Occupant Vehicles (MOV). The primary objective for all teams is to successfully complete the base route of the event without trailering their solar cars. Learn more about the other objectives of each class here.
