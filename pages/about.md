The Innovators Educational Foundation (IEF) is the non-profit organization behind collegiate level solar car racing in North America. These solar car competitions have been occurring since the 1990 GM Sunrayce USA. In recent years, IEF has been organizing and hosting two unique solar racing events.

The American Solar Challenge (ASC) is a competition to design, build and drive solar-powered cars across the country in an endurance challenge. The Formula Sun Grand Prix (FSGP) is a track style race that provides teams the opportunity to test and compete off the open road. These events promote:

* A greater understanding of solar energy technology, its environmental benefits and its promise for the future
* Educational excellence in science, engineering, and mathematics and the creative integration of technical and scientific expertise across a range of disciplines
* A “hands-on” opportunity for students and engineers to develop and demonstrate their technical and creative abilities
